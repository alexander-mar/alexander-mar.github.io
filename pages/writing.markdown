Here, I will write more general pieces I still think are important or interesting:

### 29 Jan - why some daily goals are better than others

I started 2024 off with what likely was the most rigorous goal planning I've ever done. 

I have things I want to achieve over the year, broken into quarterly, monthly, weekly, and daily goals. I actually hesitate to use the word goals because I would describe it more as habits or behaviours - especially for each day - that will help me achieve my yearly goals. For example, I want to read 52 books this year, so one of the daily behaviours/habits is to read every night right before I go to sleep.

For this first month, I set myself 6 things I wanted to do each day (or >90% of the days of the month). They were all challenging in their own unique ways but valuable and important to me becoming who I want to become.

I realised that of the 6 some had significantly more positive impacts on me than others. 

These were 2 daily habits that have had massive compound effects:

1. working out every morning
2. reading right before I go to sleep every night

I've worked out most days for the last few years and been reading a lot ever since I was a kid, so neither of these habits were new to me. But here was my thinking. 

Starting my day with a workout (rather than trying to fit it into the evening) would: 1. force me to wake up early before work, 2. ensure I get my workout done no matter what, 3. have me feeling good for the rest of the day since I know I accomplished something hard, 4. make it more likely for me to make healthy decisions throughout the day, 5. force me to go to sleep early that night (since by the time it's late I'd be pretty wrecked).

Reading every night would also have a stream of positive effects. I would be: 1. consistently reading even more - at least a few pages every night, 2. using my phone less, since doomscrolling would end up being the substitute, 3. go to sleep in a much more relaxed state and get better sleep.

It's the compound effects of both these habits that really has had a massive impact on this first month of 2024. I even love the fact that each day is bookmarked by them.

It's hard to even compare them with some of my other goals, like doing a daily german lesson on babel - great, but with much less positive impact on the rest of my day.
