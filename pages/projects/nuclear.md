# nuclear physics

I've been fascinated by nuclear since highschool. Unfortunately, I haven't been able to spend much time thinking about it until recently, when I've started to come across some really interesting startups building new types of reactors, both fusion and fission.

In order to understand these companies better, and to fufil my curiousity, I decided to do a deep dive over Q1 2025. I wanted to include some of my favourite resources here, so that I can return to them, and so that anyone else who is interested can use them.

I find the way I learn best is in three stages. Firstly, by consuming a lot of information passively, without worrying too much about the details, to build a base. I then refine this with some more active work where I increase complexity. And thirdly, by pushing myself to generate intelligent output - either in writing or in conversations.

**step 1 - passive info build up**
1. podcasts - age of miracles by turpentine is exceptional, highly recommend
2. movies - oppenheimar was 10/10
3. youtube videos - smarter every day has a few great videos about nuclear reactorss

**step 2 - partial active**
1. introductory textbook
2. reading books
3. youtube MIT series

**step 3 - very active**
1. tough textbooks, and trying to work through problems 
2. writing about the topic 
3. talking to smart people
