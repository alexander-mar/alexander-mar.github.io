<p>I’ve been fascinated by nuclear since highschool. Unfortunately, I haven’t been able to spend much time thinking about it until recently, when I’ve started to come across some really interesting startups building new types of reactors, both fusion and fission.</p>

<p>In order to understand these companies better, and to fufil my curiousity, I decided to do a deep dive over Q1 2025. I wanted to include some of my favourite resources here, so that I can return to them, and so that anyone else who is interested can use them.</p>

<p>I find the way I learn best is in three stages. Firstly, by consuming a lot of information passively, without worrying too much about the details, to build a base. I then refine this with some more active work where I increase complexity. And thirdly, by pushing myself to generate intelligent output - either in writing or in conversations.</p>

<p><strong>step 1 - passive info build up</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>podcasts - age of miracles by turpentine is exceptional, highly recommend</li>
  <li>movies - oppenheimar was 10/10</li>
  <li>youtube videos - smarter every day has a few great videos about nuclear reactorss</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>step 2 - partial active</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>introductory textbook</li>
  <li>reading books</li>
  <li>youtube MIT series</li>
</ol>

<p><strong>step 3 - very active</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>tough textbooks, and trying to work through problems</li>
  <li>writing about the topic</li>
  <li>talking to smart people</li>
</ol>
