    <p>As one of my favorite essayists, the great Henrik Karlsson, beautifully expressed: ‘Write in a way that lets you refine your thoughts about the things that matter.’ And so that’s what this is. A place for me to refine my ideas on mental models I have seen in venture capital.</p>

<p>I expect and hope for this to be a continual work in progress. If you disagree with something, let me know on what and why.</p>

<p>The eventual goal here is that over many investments I can look back at the patterns and systems I have witnessed, fallen victem to, and profited from to understand decision making, human nature, and business.</p>

<p>Investing, in more ways than you’d expect, is like dating.</p>

<p>You take account of what you’re looking for, and make a decision based off your values and what you have access to. We are going to make the massive assumption that the companies you are interested in are interested in you - sadly we aren’t all ledonardo dicaprio but let’s assume we are.</p>

<p>Let’s say you want to invest in a business that writes blog posts for VCs. You look at the 5 best on the market, sadly they are all about a 6/10, and you invest in number 5. You join the board and have a vested interest in the company.</p>

<p>Once you do invest in a company as a VC, you are excluding a large number of other companies that do the same thing. Just as in most marrigaes you are excluding other potential partners with your decision.</p>

<p>The issue is that you must not only compare</p>
